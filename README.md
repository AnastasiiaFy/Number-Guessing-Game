# Number-Guessing-Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the Number Guessing game! The goal of this command-line game is to guess the number thought out by the computer. Three levels of difficulty are available to you, which will determine how many chances you have to guess the number:
1. Easy - 10 chances
2. Medium - 5 chances
3. Hard - 3 chances

The number will be in the range of 1 to 100 in the first round, but with each subsequent round, range will rise. After each round, you can either finish the game or choose to play on. When you decide to finish the game, the table showing the top attempts at each difficulty level will be shown.
